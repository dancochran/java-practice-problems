# RotateArray

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
```
